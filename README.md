# Statistical test to find the probability of hitting a ship in the game Sea Battle

Status: ongoing (data collection)

## Intro

Sea Battle is an online game on a mobile gaming app called 'Plato'. It is an online version of the traditional board game 'Battleship' with slight modifications.

Players are given 6 ships of different sizes and they are arranged on a 10x10 square tiles before the game commence. Each player can shoot one tile per turn. If the shot hits a ship, the shooting player may perform another shot. The first player to shoot down all of the enemy's ship wins the game.

This investigation aims to find the probability of hitting a ship on any square tiles based on the position of enemies' ships from completed games.
